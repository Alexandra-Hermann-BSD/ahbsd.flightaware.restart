# ahbsd.flightaware.restart
Command line project for helping to automatize some restarts of PiAware

I'm using **PiAware** from [FlightAware](https://flightaware.com/) to add Flight Data from my location. 
Since my Raspberry Pi is at a location only linked with PowerLine, and the PowerLine connector often 
has some problems, it must be checked, wheather the stati are correct or not. If not the processes must be restartet.

So I started this project to automate this stati test and auto restart.
Additionally it's also to learn how *Mono* on *Raspberry Pi* works :)
